                            <p>
                                While my professional experience is just beginning, I've developed a strong foundation in software
                                engineering and teamwork through labs and projects during my time in school. I am also excited to 
                                expand my knowledge in industry-standard technologies while also being able to apply the skills I've
                                developed throughout my education.

                            <p>
                                I am proficient in Python, Java, SQL, and JavaScript with some experience in C, C++, and oCaml. A
                                large segment in my experience is within web development where my expertise is primarily in backend
                                development, however I enjoy exploring frontend development and database management as well. I enjoy
                                solving complex problems and learning new technologies, and I am excited to expand my skills past what
                                I've learned in school.

                            <p>
                                All the way back in high school, I thought I wanted to be a mechanical engineer, until I took my first
                                physics course! I was lucky enough to have a great computer science teacher, and I quickly realized that
                                I loved programming. Since then, I have continued to learn and grow as a programmer, and programming has
                                found its way into much of my life. I am excited to continue to learn and grow as a software engineer
                                throughout both my career and in my personal projects.
